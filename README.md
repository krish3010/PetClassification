# PetClassification
Based off on a project on Coursera Course (Tensorflow Specialization).

Instead of building our own Neural Net, We use the concept of Transfer Learning.

Used Inception Network Layer 7 as the intermediary weights and extended 2 layers from that. 

I have also saved the model so that I need not do the training again. 

I added an option of uploading an Image and then it gives out the ouput whether its a cat or a dog. It has almost 99% accuracy in differenciating between cat and dog.

This weights used in the final step can also be used for classification of humans and horses with an accuracy of 98%.
